# simple-synchronizers
Here to will find designs of few simple sinchronizres and how they work. 

Every design will include:
* Block diagram.
* System-Verilog code.
* Testbench.
* Brief explanation.

Please note that in order to simulate meta-stable states I used an uncertainty model. The model in use will be the same throughout the various synchronizers.
The uncertainty model was created by one of my university teachers mr. Refael Gantz.
