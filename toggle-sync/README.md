This synchronizer is a robust design for a pulse synchronizer.

It is capable of synchronizing pulses in various situations.
This synchronizer can be used when the output clock is slower than the input clock. Thus replacing the need for pulse extension (when the relation between the clocks is known) and hand shake synchronizer (when the relation between the clocks is unknown).
it should be noted that is can also be used when the output clock is faster but it is "overkill", because it can be done using simple synchronizers.
