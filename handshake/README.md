This is another robust build of the pulse synchronizer; this synchronizer can be used when the relation between the clock is unknown.

In this synchronizer the is a feedback loop that notifies when the signal was synchronized, until then the signal is extended.

Because of the fact that there are two synchronizers in this build the synchronization process can take a lot of times. Also this synchronizer is using the using the highest number of components as oppose to the other synchronizers, but it is the most robust build.
