This synchronizer is useful when the domain a’s clock is faster than domain b’s clock. 

The signal is extended to meet the required length in order to be synchronized. There are multiple ways that the pulse can be extended, for now I will show you the cases where domain a’s clock is 2 times faster than domain b’s clock.

Note that this kind of synchronizer is useful when the relation between the clocks in known.

In the near future I will implement a signal extension system synchronizer using a counter.
